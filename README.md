# TF_DisTorBFact_Calc
(Prototype) Python pipeline for calculating distances and torsion angles of relevant bonds for CPD, 6-4PP, and TAPP formation using PDB files. Also includes a B-Factor analysis at the end. 

This pipeline will search for PDB files in a given directory and parse through them to calculate distances and torsion angles of relevant bonds for CPD formation, distances and torsion angles of relevant bonds for 6-4PP formation, distances and torsion angles of relevant bonds for TAPP formation, and the average B-Factor across a section of DNA. It is designed to use PDB files of transcription factors bound to their DNA binding sites. For the version designed to use nucleosome structures, see the "Nuc" repositories.
